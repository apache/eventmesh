# Maturity Self Assessment for Apache EventMesh (incubating)

The goals of this maturity model are to describe how Apache projects operate in a concise and high-level way, and to provide a basic framework that projects may choose to use to evaluate themselves.

More details can be found [here](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html).

## Status of this assessment

Mentors and community members are encouraged to contribute to this page and comment on it, the following tables summarize our self-assessment against the **Apache Project Maturity Model**.

- :white_check_mark: means that the related item is in good status.
- :white_large_square: means that the related item need long-term attention.

## Maturity model assessment

**CODE**

| **ID**   | **Description** | **Status** |
| -------- | ----- | ---------- |
| **CD10** | The project produces Open Source software for distribution to the public, at no charge.                                                                                                                                                                         | :white_check_mark:  The project source code is licensed under the `Apache License 2.0`. |
| **CD20** | Anyone can easily discover and access the project's code.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | :white_check_mark:  The [offical website](https://eventmesh.apache.org/) includes `Github` link which can access GitHub directly. |
| **CD30** | Anyone using standard, widely-available tools, can build the code in a reproducible way.                                                                                                                                                                       | :white_check_mark:   Apache EventMesh provide [how-to-build](https://github.com/apache/incubator-eventmesh/blob/master/docs/en/instruction/02-runtime.md) document to tell user how to compile on bare metal. |
| **CD40** | The full history of the project's code is available via a source code control system, in a way that allows anyone to recreate any released version.                                                                                                            | :white_check_mark:  It depends on git, and anyone can view the full history of the project via commit logs. |
| **CD50** | The source code control system establishes the provenance of each line of code in a reliable way, based on strong authentication of the committer. When third parties contribute code, commit messages provide reliable information about the code provenance. | :white_check_mark:  The project uses GitHub and managed by Apache Infra, it ensuring provenance of each line of code to a committer. |

| **CS10** | The project maintains a public list of its contributors who have decision power. The project's PMC (Project Management Committee) consists of those contributors. | :white_check_mark:  See [members](https://eventmesh.apache.org/team/member) with all PPMC members and committers.  |
| **CS20** | Decisions require a consensus among PMC members and are documented on the project's main communications channel. The PMC takes community opinions into account, but the PMC has the final word. | :white_check_mark:  All decisions are made by votes on dev@eventmesh.apache.org, and with at least 3 PPMC's/IPMC's +1 binding |
| **CS30** | The project uses documented voting rules to build consensus when discussion is not sufficient. | :white_check_mark:  The project uses the standard ASF voting rules.                                                |

The person exercising the veto must justify it with a technical explanation, as per the Apache voting rules defined in CS30. | :white_check_mark:  Apache Eventmesh community has not used the veto power yet except for code commits.            |
| **CS50** | All "important" discussions happen asynchronously in written form on the project's main communications channel.

### Deployment EventMesh Store

> EventMesh now supports `standalone`, `RocketMQ`, `Kafka` and other middleware as a storage.      
> If you are in non-`standalone` mode, you need to deploy the required `store` first, using `rocketmq` mode as an example: Deploy [RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org/docs/quickStart/01quickstart/).  

### Deployment EventMesh Runtime  

The EventMesh Runtime is a stateful mesh node in an EventMesh cluster that is responsible for event transfer between the Source Connector and the Sink Connector, and can use Event Store as a storage queue for events.  

#### Run on your local machine

Dependencies:
- 64-bit OS, we recommend Linux/Unix.
- 64-bit JDK 1.8 or JDK 11
- Gradle 7.0+, The recommended version can be found in the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file.

##### 1ÔºâRun from source code

1.Download source code:   
Download and extract the source code of the latest release from [EventMesh download](https://eventmesh.apache.org/download/).For example, with the current latest version, you will get `apache-eventmesh-1.10.0-source.tar.gz`.

There are two ways to install the plugin:

- classpath loading: Local developers can install the plugin by declaring it in the eventmesh-starter module build.gradle, e.g., declare that it uses the rocketmq plugin  
```
implementation project(":eventmesh-connectors:eventmesh-connector-rocketmq")
```

- File loading: By installing the plugin to the plugin directory, EventMesh will automatically load the plugins in the plugin directory according to the conditions at runtime, you can install the plugin by executing the following command  
```
./gradlew clean jar dist && ./gradlew installPlugin
```

3.Using Plugins   

EventMesh will load plugins in the `dist/plugin` directory by default, you can change the plugin directory with `-DeventMeshPluginDir=your_plugin_directory`. Examples of plugins to be used at runtime can be found in the `confPath` directory under `eventmesh.properties`. For example declare the use of the rocketmq plugin at runtime with the following settings.  
```
#connector plugin
eventMesh.connector.plugin.type=rocketmq
```

4.Configuring the VM startup parameters  
```
-Dlog4j.configurationFile=eventmesh-runtime/conf/log4j2.xml
-Deventmesh.log.home=eventmesh-runtime/logs
-Deventmesh.home=eventmesh-runtime
-DconfPath=eventmesh-runtime/conf
```
> Note: If your operating system is Windows, you may need to replace the file separator with `'\'`.

5.Getting up and running
```
Run org.apache.eventmesh.starter.
```

##### 2) Run form local binary

1.Download Source Code

Download and extract the source code of the latest release from [EventMesh download](https://eventmesh.apache.org/download/).For example, with the current latest version, you will get apache-eventmesh-1.10.0-source.tar.gz.
```
tar -xvzf apache-eventmesh-1.10.0-source.tar.gz
cd apache-eventmesh-1.10.0-src/
```

Build the source code with Gradle.
```
gradle clean dist
```

Edit the `eventmesh.properties` to change the configuration (e.g. TCP port, client blacklist) of EventMesh Runtime.  
```
cd dist
vim conf/eventmesh.properties
```

2.Build and Load Plugins    
Apache EventMesh introduces the SPI (Service Provider Interface) mechanism, which enables EventMesh to discover and load the plugins at runtime.The plugins could be installed with these methods:  
- Gradle Dependencies: Declare the plugins as the build dependencies in `eventmesh-starter/build.gradle`.  
```
dependencies {
   implementation project(":eventmesh-runtime")

    // Example: Load the RocketMQ plugin
   implementation project(":eventmesh-connectors:eventmesh-connector-rocketmq")
}
```

- Plugin directory: EventMesh loads the plugins in the `dist/plugin` directory based on `eventmesh.properties`. The `installPlugin` task of Gradle builds and moves the plugins into the `dist/plugin` directory.
```
gradle installPlugin
```

3.Start Runtime

Execute the `start.sh` script to start the EventMesh Runtime server.
```
bash bin/start.sh
```

View the output log:  
```
tail -f logs/eventmesh.out
```

#### Remote deployment

1.Download:

Download and extract the executable binaries of the latest release from[EventMesh download](https://eventmesh.apache.org/download/).For example, with the current latest version, you will get `apache-eventmesh-1.10.0.tar.gz`.  
```
tar -xvzf apache-eventmesh-1.10.0-bin.tar.gz
cd apache-eventmesh-1.10.0
```

2.Deploy  

Edit the `eventmesh.properties` to change the configuration (e.g. TCP port, client blacklist) of EventMesh Runtime. The executable binaries contain all plugins in the bundle, thus there's no need to build them from source code.
```
vim conf/eventmesh.properties
```

Execute the `start.sh` script to start the EventMesh Runtime server.
```
bash bin/start.sh
```
If you see `EventMeshTCPServer[port=10000] started....`, then the setup was successful.

View the output log:
```
cd /root/apache-eventmesh-1.10.0/logs
tail -f eventmesh.out
```

You can stop the run with the following command:  
```
bash bin/stop.sh
```

#### EventMesh Runtime with Docker

Dependencies:  
- 64-bit OS, we recommend Linux/Unix.   
- 64-bit JDK 1.8 or JDK 11.    
- Gradle 7.0+, The recommended version can be found in the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file.  

1.Pull EventMesh Image  
Download the pre-built image of [eventmesh](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/eventmesh) from Docker Hub with docker pull:
```
sudo docker pull apache/eventmesh:v1.10.0
```

To verify that the apache/eventmesh image is successfully installed, list the downloaded images with docker images:  
```
$ sudo docker images
REPOSITORY            TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
apache/eventmesh   v1.10.0    6e2964599c78     10 days ago     937MB
```

2.Edit Configuration:    
Edit the `eventmesh.properties` to change the configuration (e.g. TCP port, client blacklist) of EventMesh Runtime. To integrate RocketMQ as a connector, these two configuration files should be created: `eventmesh.properties` and `rocketmq-client.properties`.
```
sudo mkdir -p /data/eventmesh/rocketmq/conf
cd /data/eventmesh/rocketmq/conf
sudo touch eventmesh.properties
sudo touch rocketmq-client.properties
```

3.Configure `eventmesh.properties`   

The `eventmesh.properties` file contains the properties of EventMesh Runtime environment and integrated plugins.Please refer to the [default configuration file](https://github.com/apache/eventmesh/blob/1.10.0-prepare/eventmesh-runtime/conf/eventmesh.properties) for the available configuration keys.  
```
sudo vim eventmesh.properties
``` 

Please check if the default port in the configuration file is occupied, if it is occupied please change it to an unoccupied port:

| Configuration Key            | Default Value | Description                  |   
|------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|  
| `eventMesh.server.http.port` | `10105`       | `EventMesh http server port` |  
| `eventMesh.server.tcp.port`  | `10000`       | `EventMesh tcp server port`  | 
| `eventMesh.server.grpc.port` | `10205`       | `EventMesh grpc server port` | 

4.Configure `rocketmq-client.properties`

The `rocketmq-client.properties` file contains the properties of the Apache RocketMQ nameserver.

```
sudo vim eventmesh.properties
```
Please refer to the [default configuration file](https://github.com/apache/eventmesh/blob/1.10.0-prepare/eventmesh-storage-plugin/eventmesh-storage-rocketmq/src/main/resources/rocketmq-client.properties) and change the value of eventMesh.server.rocketmq.namesrvAddr to the nameserver address of RocketMQ.
> Note that if the `nameserver` address you are running is not the default in the configuration file, change it to the `nameserver` address that is actually running.

Please check if the `default namesrvAddr` in the configuration file is occupied, if it is occupied please change it to an unoccupied address:

| Configuration Key	                      | Default Value	                  | Description                        |   
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
| `eventMesh.server.rocketmq.namesrvAddr` | `127.0.0.1:9876;127.0.0.1:9876` | `RocketMQ namesrv default address` |

5.Run and Manage EventMesh Container  

Run an EventMesh container from the `apache/eventmesh` image with the `docker run` command.  
- The `-p` option of the command binds the container port with the host machine port.
- The `-v` option of the command mounts the configuration files from files in the host machine.  
- 
```
sudo docker run -d \
    -p 10000:10000 -p 10105:10105 \
    -v /data/eventmesh/rocketmq/conf/eventMesh.properties:/data/app/eventmesh/conf/eventMesh.properties \
    -v /data/eventmesh/rocketmq/conf/rocketmq-client.properties:/data/app/eventmesh/conf/rocketmq-client.properties \
    apache/eventmesh:v1.10.0
```
If you see a new line of output after running the command, the container running the EventMesh image has started successfully.

The docker ps command lists the details (id, name, status, etc.) of the running containers. The container id is the unique identifier of the container.
```
$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                                                          NAMES
5bb6b6092672   apache/eventmesh:v1.10.0   "/bin/sh -c 'sh star‚Ä¶"     5 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds   0.0.0.0:10000->10000/tcp, :::10000->10000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10105->10105/tcp, :::10105->10105/tcp   eager_driscoll
```

6.Managing EventMesh Containers     
After successfully running an EventMesh container, you can manage the container by entering it, viewing logs, deleting it, and so on.  
To connect to the EventMesh container:
```
sudo docker exec -it [your container id or name] /bin/bash
```

To read the log of the EventMesh container:
```
cd ../logs
tail -f eventmesh.out
```

To stop or remove the container:
```
sudo docker stop [container id or name]
sudo docker rm -f [container id or name]
```

### eventmesh-sdk-java demo

> eventmesh-sdk-java acts as a client of EventMesh Runtime and communicates with it, to publish and subscribe the messages.   
>  
> The eventmesh-sdk-java supports ASYNC messages and BROADCAST messages. ASYNC messages indicate that producers only send messages and do not care about receiving reply messages. BROADCAST messages mean that producers send a message once, and all consumers subscribed to the broadcast topic will receive the message.     
>  
> eventmesh-sdk-java supports HTTP, TCP and gRPC protocols.  

The test demos of TCP, HTTP and GRPC are in the module `eventmesh-examples`.  

#### 1.TCP

##### 1.1 ASYNC

- Start consumer to subscribe the topic (we have created the `TEST-TOPIC-TCP-ASYNC` by default, you can also create other topic to test)
```
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.tcp.demo.sub.eventmeshmessage.AsyncSubscribe
```

- Start producer to publish async message
```
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.tcp.demo.pub.eventmeshmessage.AsyncPublish
```

##### 1.2 BROADCAST
- Start subscriber to subscribe the topic (we have created the `TEST-TOPIC-TCP-BROADCAST` by default, you can also create other topic to test)
```
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.tcp.demo.sub.eventmeshmessage.AsyncSubscribeBroadcast
```
- Start publisher to publish async message
````
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.tcp.demo.pub.eventmeshmessage.AsyncPublishBroadcast
````

#### 2.HTTP
> For HTTP, the eventmesh-sdk-java implements sending and subscribing to asynchronous events.  
> 
> In the demo, the `content` field of the Java class `EventMeshMessage` represents a special protocol. Therefore, if you are using the eventmesh-sdk-java's http-client, you only need to design the content of the protocol and provide the consumer's application at the same time.   

##### 2.1 ASYNC
- The subscriber is a SpringBoot demo, so run this demo to start subscriber (we have created the topic `TEST-TOPIC-HTTP-ASYNC` by default, you can also create other topic to test)
```
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.http.demo.sub.SpringBootDemoApplication
```

> Start publisher to publish message
```
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.http.demo.pub.eventmeshmessage.AsyncPublishInstance
```

#### 3.GRPC

> The eventmesh-sdk-java implements the gRPC protocol. It can asynchronously or synchronously send events to the EventMesh Runtime.  
> 
> It can subscribe to consume events through Webhook and event streaming, and also supports the CNCF CloudEvents protocol. 

##### 3.1 ASYNC Publish & Webhook Subscribe
> Producers can asynchronously send events to the EventMesh Runtime without waiting for the events to be stored in the Event Store.
> 
> For Webhook consumers, events will be pushed to the consumer's HTTP Endpoint URL, i.e., the consumer's `subscribeUrl`. This method is similar to the previously mentioned Http EventMesh client.  

- Start publisher to publish message (we have created the topic `TEST-TOPIC-GRPC-ASYNC` by default, you can also create other topic to test)
```
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.grpc.pub.eventmeshmessage.AsyncPublishInstance
```

- Start webhook subscriber
```
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.grpc.sub.app.SpringBootDemoApplication
```

##### 3.2 SYNC Publish & Stream Subscribe
> Producers synchronously send events to the EventMesh Runtime while waiting for the events to be stored in the Event Store.  
> 
> For event stream consumers, events are pushed in a streaming to the ReceiveMsgHook client. This method is similar to the EventMesh client.  

- Start Request-Reply publisher to publish message (we have created the topic `TEST-TOPIC-GRPC-RR` by default, you can also create other topic to test)
```
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.grpc.pub.eventmeshmessage.RequestReplyInstance
```

- Start stream subscriber
```
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.grpc.sub.EventmeshAsyncSubscribe
```

##### 3.3 Publish BATCH Message
> Asynchronously batch publish multiple events to the EventMesh Runtime.
- Start publisher to publish batch message (we have created the `TEST-TOPIC-GRPC-ASYNC` by default, you can also create other topic to test.)
```
Run the main method of org.apache.eventmesh.grpc.pub.eventmeshmessage.BatchPublishInstance
```

# Creative Theme for Jekyll

A Jekyll implementation of the [Creative Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative/) template by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com).

An attractive one page Bootstrap theme perfect for creative portfolios and businesses

Based on Creative Theme v6.0.4 and Bootstrap v4.5.3.

## To use the Creative Theme template in your project

Creating a site with this particular Jekyll theme, is basically writing a markdown site.

- Start by adding your info in `_config.yml`.
- Don't forget to change `_data/footer.yml` to update the copyright.
- In `index.md` reorder or remove section as you prefer.
- You can also add other pages, like `links.md`.
- Edit `_data/menus.yml` to add links in the navigation bar.

# Development
If you want to use this template, or enhance it, you can use Docker.
Just run './build-in-docker.sh' and then point your browser to http://localhost:4000/.

Note: Developing for github pages is tricky. You should alway rely on
[safe plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/) because any other, that's not
in the list will simply not run.

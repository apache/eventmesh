/**
 * Interface for handling ConnectRecords via HTTP or HTTPS. Classes implementing this interface are responsible for processing ConnectRecords by
 * sending them over HTTP or HTTPS, with additional support for handling multiple requests and asynchronous processing.
 *
 * <p>Any class that needs to process ConnectRecords via HTTP or HTTPS should implement this interface.
 * Implementing classes must provide implementations for the {@link #start()}, {@link #handle(ConnectRecord)},
 * {@link #deliver(URI, HttpConnectRecord)}, and {@link #stop()} methods.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementing classes should ensure thread safety and handle HTTP/HTTPS communication efficiently.
 * The {@link #start()} method initializes any necessary resources for HTTP/HTTPS communication. The {@link #handle(ConnectRecord)} method processes a
 * ConnectRecord by sending it over HTTP or HTTPS. The {@link #deliver(URI, HttpConnectRecord)} method processes HttpConnectRecord on specified URL
 * while returning its own processing logic {@link #stop()} method releases any resources used for HTTP/HTTPS communication.</p>
 *
 * <p>It's recommended to handle exceptions gracefully within the {@link #deliver(URI, HttpConnectRecord)} method
 * to prevent message loss or processing interruptions.</p>

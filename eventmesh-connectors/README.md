# Connectors

## Connector

A connector is a bridge that interacts with a specific external service or underlying data source (e.g., Databases) on behalf of user applications. A connector is either a Source or a Sink.

## Source

A source connector obtains data from an underlying data producer, and delivers it to targets after original data has been transformed into CloudEvents. It doesn't limit the way how a source retrieves data. (e.g., A source may pull data from a message queue or act as an HTTP server waiting for data sent to it).

CloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in common formats to provide interoperability across services, platforms and systems.

## Sink

A sink connector receives CloudEvents and does some specific business logics. (e.g., A MySQL Sink extracts useful data from CloudEvents and writes them to a MySQL database).

## Implements

Add a new connector by implementing the source/sink interface using [eventmesh-openconnect-java](https://github.com/apache/eventmesh/tree/master/eventmesh-openconnect/eventmesh-openconnect-java).

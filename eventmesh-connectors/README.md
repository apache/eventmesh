# Connectors

## Connector 
A connector is a bridge that interacts with a specific external service or underlying data source (e.g., Databases) on behalf of user applications. A connector is either a Source or a Sink.

## Source
A source connector obtains data from an underlying data producer, and delivers it to targets after original data has been transformed into CloudEvents. It doesn't limit the way how a source retrieves data. (e.g., A source may pull data from a message queue or act as an HTTP server waiting for data sent to it).

## Sink 
A sink connector receives CloudEvents and does some specific business logics. (e.g., A MySQL Sink extracts useful data from CloudEvents and writes them to a MySQL database).
CloudEvents - A specification for describing event data in common formats to provide interoperability across services, platforms and systems.

## Implements
Add a new connector by implementing the source/sink interface using :

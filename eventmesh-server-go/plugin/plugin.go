// Package plugin implements a general plugin factory system which provides plugin registration and loading.
// It is mainly used when certain plugins must be loaded by configuration.
// This system is not supposed to register plugins that do not rely on configuration like codec. Instead, plugins
// that do not rely on configuration should be registered by calling methods in certain packages.

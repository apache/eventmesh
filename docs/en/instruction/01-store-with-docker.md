## Download

Download the Binary code (recommended: 4.9.*) from [RocketMQ Official](https://rocketmq.apache.org/dowloading/releases/). Here we take 4.9.4 as an example.

```
unzip rocketmq-all-4.9.4-bin-release.zip
cd rocketmq-4.9.4/
```

## Deploy

- #### Start Name Server

```
nohup sh bin/mqnamesrv &
tail -f ~/logs/rocketmqlogs/namesrv.log
```

- #### Start Broker

```
nohup sh bin/mqbroker -n localhost:9876 &
tail -f ~/logs/rocketmqlogs/broker.log
```

The deployment of eventmesh-store has finished, please go to the next step: [Start Eventmesh-Runtime](02-runtime.md)

## Deploy

Pull RocketMQ image from Docker Hub：

```shell
#Get RocketMQ image
sudo docker pull apache/rocketmq:4.9.4
```

Start namesrv  and broker

```shell
#Run namerv container
sudo docker run -d -p 9876:9876 -v `pwd`/data/namesrv/logs:/root/logs -v `pwd`/data/namesrv/store:/root/store --name rmqnamesrv  apache/rocketmq:4.9.4 sh mqnamesrv

#Run broker container
sudo docker run -d -p 10911:10911 -p 10909:10909 -v `pwd`/data/broker/logs:/root/logs -v `pwd`/data/broker/store:/root/store --name rmqbroker --link rmqnamesrv:namesrv -e "NAMESRV_ADDR=namesrv:9876" apache/rocketmq:4.9.4 sh mqbroker -c ../conf/broker.conf
```

Please note that the **rocketmq-broker ip** is **pod ip**. If you want to modify this ip, you can set it your custom value in **broker.conf**。

By now, the deployment of eventmesh-store has finished, please go to the next step: [Start Eventmesh-Runtime Using Docker](02-runtime-with-docker.md)

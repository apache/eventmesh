## What is Event Mesh?
This figure shows the positioning of the event mesh relative to other similar technologies (such as service mesh) in the application framework.
![architecture1](images/eventmesh-define.png)

Event Mesh is a dynamic plug-in cloud-native basic service layer used to decouple the application and middleware layer. It provides flexible, reliable and fast event distribution, and can be managed.

Cloud Native Event Mesh:
![architecture2](/images/bus.png)

The event mesh allows events from one application to be dynamically routed to any other application.
General functions of the event mesh:
* Event driven;
* Event governance;
* Dynamic routing;
* Cloud native

Dependent components:
* DeFiBus : a distributed messaging platform with low latency, high performance and reliability, flexible scalability. [DeFiBus](https://github.com/WeBankFinTech/DeFiBus)
* RocketMQ

Key components:
* eventmesh-emesher : an middleware to transmit events between event producers and consumers, support cloud native apps and microservices
* eventmesh-sdk-java : currently supports HTTP and TCP protocols, and will support gRPC in the future
* eventmesh-registry : automatically routes events between applications and services connected to seperate event meshers, manage eventmesh-emesher
